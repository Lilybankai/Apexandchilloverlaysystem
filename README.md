# Apex Overlay System

Lightweight **rFactor 2 / Le Mans Ultimate** telemetry overlay system for the
**Apex & Chill Racing League** live streams.

It reads sim telemetry from the rF2/LMU shared-memory plugin, normalizes it, and
broadcasts it over a local WebSocket to a set of branded browser overlays that
are added to OBS as **Browser Sources** and positioned over the sim's own HUD.

```
 rF2 / LMU  ──(shared memory)──►  Node telemetry server  ──(WebSocket JSON)──►  OBS Browser Source overlays
 (telemetry plugin)               (this app, lightweight)                        (standings, pedals, relative,
                                                                                  weather, tyres, fuel)
```

## Two ways to run it

- **Desktop app (recommended for streamers)** — a Windows installer (`Setup.exe`)
  that installs a small control-panel app. Open it, tick the overlays you want,
  set the port / update rate / demo mode, and copy each overlay's URL into OBS.
  No terminal, no commands. See [Desktop app](#desktop-app).
- **Headless server (developers)** — run the Node server directly with
  `npm start`. See [Getting started](#getting-started).

The telemetry engine is identical in both; the desktop app just wraps the same
server in an Electron window for people who don't want a command line. Overlays
still render inside the Chromium instance **OBS already runs** for Browser
Sources, so there is no extra renderer on stream. Telemetry is broadcast as
compact JSON at a configurable rate (default 30 Hz).

## Desktop app

Build the installer:

```bash
npm install
npm run app:dist     # -> release/Apex Overlay System Setup <version>.exe
```

Run the app in development (no packaging):

```bash
npm run app          # builds the server, then launches the Electron window
```

The control panel:

- **Overlays** — tick the ones you want; each has its own URL + **Copy** and
  **Preview** buttons. Add each as a **separate OBS Browser Source** and drag it
  into position inside OBS.
- **Settings** — server port, update rate (1–120 Hz), and a **Demo mode** toggle
  that forces simulated data (no sim/plugin needed).
- **Status pill** — shows LIVE / DEMO DATA / NO DATA / STOPPED at a glance.

Settings are saved to `%APPDATA%/apex-overlay-system/config.json` and restored on
next launch. The server starts automatically when the app opens.

### Auto-update

The app checks GitHub Releases on launch (via `electron-updater`). When a newer
version is published, a banner appears in the control panel: **Download &
install** fetches it, then **Restart & update** applies it. Updates are never
auto-installed, so a live stream is not interrupted.

To publish a new version:

```bash
# bump "version" in package.json, then:
GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) npm run release   # builds + uploads to GitHub Releases
```

Existing installs (v0.4.0+) will offer the update automatically. Note: builds are
unsigned, so Windows SmartScreen shows an "unknown publisher" prompt on first
install and on each update ("More info → Run anyway").

## Overlays

Positioned to sit on top of the LMU/RaceLab HUD with solid, opaque backgrounds:

- **Standings** (top-left) — full field, gaps, pit status
- **Relative / timing** (top-right) — nearest cars on track, live delta
- **Pedal inputs** (bottom-center) — throttle/brake trace, trail-braking style
- **Tyre temps** — four-corner temperatures
- **Weather forecast** — current + short forecast
- **Fuel calculator** — per-lap use, laps remaining, fuel-to-finish, pit window

## Live telemetry sources

The server can read live data three ways (set `APEX_PROVIDER`, default `lmu`):

| Provider     | Source                                   | Best for                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `lmu` (default) | **Le Mans Ultimate REST API** on `http://localhost:6397` | Broadcasting/directing — whole-field standings, gaps, timing, weather, fuel. Robust across LMU updates. |
| `rf2`        | rF2/LMU **shared-memory** plugin         | Showing the **locally-driven** car's pedals, gear, RPM, tyres. |
| `simulator`  | Built-in synthetic data                  | Demos / building overlays with no sim open. |

Any provider that can't reach its source falls back to the **simulator** so the
overlays keep running (flagged as demo) instead of freezing.

**LMU REST API (recommended):** no plugin needed — it's LMU's own built-in web
API (the one behind `http://localhost:6397/swagger`). Just have LMU running.
Because the API exposes the *whole field*, it drives standings, relative/timing,
weather and fuel for the whole grid.

For the **locally-driven car**, the `lmu` provider additionally reads shared
memory (when the plugin is present) to add that car's **pedal inputs** and
**fuel in litres** — so a driver-streamer gets a live pedal trace and the full
fuel calculator on top of the REST timing. This is automatic and best-effort: no
local car (pure spectating) simply means those come from REST (fuel) or stay
empty (pedals).

**Tyre temps on LMU:** not available. LMU restructured its per-wheel shared-memory
layout away from the documented rF2 `rF2Wheel` struct, so there is no reliable
offset for tyre temperatures on current builds; the tyres overlay is best hidden.

**Shared-memory (`rf2`):** requires the **rF2 Shared Memory Map Plugin**
(`rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin64.dll`) in the sim's `Bin64/Plugins/` folder.
Note: LMU changes its struct layout between updates, so shared-memory field
offsets are version-sensitive.

## Requirements

- **Node.js 18+** (server runtime), or just run the desktop app.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install      # install dependencies (ws + TypeScript toolchain)
npm start        # builds and starts the server (http://127.0.0.1:8080)
```

Then add `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` as an OBS Browser Source (see
`docs/OBS-SETUP.md`).

### Development

```bash
npm run dev        # tsc watch build
npm run typecheck  # type-check without emitting
```

## Configuration

All settings are environment variables with lightweight defaults
(see `src/server/config.ts`):

| Variable           | Default     | Description                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `APEX_HOST`        | `127.0.0.1` | Bind host                                     |
| `APEX_HTTP_PORT`   | `8080`      | HTTP + overlay port                           |
| `APEX_WS_PORT`     | = HTTP port | WebSocket port (shares HTTP server)           |
| `APEX_WS_PATH`     | `/ws`       | WebSocket endpoint path                       |
| `APEX_UPDATE_HZ`   | `30`        | Telemetry broadcast rate (1–120 Hz)           |
| `APEX_OVERLAY_DIR` | `overlay`   | Static overlay asset directory                |
| `APEX_FORCE_SIM`   | `false`     | Force the simulator provider (demo mode)      |
| `APEX_PROVIDER`    | `lmu`       | Live source: `lmu` / `rf2` / `simulator`      |
| `APEX_LMU_PORT`    | `6397`      | LMU REST API port (when `provider` is `lmu`)  |
| `APEX_VERBOSE`     | `false`     | Verbose logging                               |

## Telemetry contract

`src/telemetry/types.ts` defines `TelemetryFrame`, the single normalized schema
shared between the telemetry producers and the overlays. Every provider maps its
raw data into this shape, so the overlays never depend on which sim is running.
The schema is versioned via `TELEMETRY_SCHEMA_VERSION`.
